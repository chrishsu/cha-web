    <h1>to be Asian</h1>
    <p>
    This is in reference to anyone with ethno-cultural heritage from the continent of Asia. While we recognize that many organizations may use terms such as AAPI, APA, API, or <a href="https://www.csusm.edu/apidafsa/who_is_apida/index.html">APIDA</a>, we believe in claiming the term of Asian in reference to pan-Asian solidarity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    We also recognize that the experiences and cultures of the Pasifika people <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/why-its-time-to-retire-the-term-asian-pacific-islander/">are distinct</a> from Asian experiences and cultures. We heartily welcome those with Pasifika heritage and hope to stand and learn alongside you. 
    </p>
    <h1>to be Catholic</h1>
    <p>
    This means being a part of the family of the Catholic Church. While we may inhabit a variety of perspectives and practices, we are willing to stick with our messy family in our journey with Christ. 
    </p>
    <h1>to be holistic</h1>
    <p>
    We recognize that the gravity of the Church has been situated on Western philosophies, theologies, experiences, and praxes. While there are many gifts that the West has both given and received from the Church, the Church is still wrestling with how other cultures shape the Church and how the inculturation of Christ takes form. To be holistic as an Asian Catholic is to celebrate where Christ has informed our cultures, to explore how Christ redeems our cultures, and to bring our whole selves as an offering to the Universal Body of Christ.

    <h1>to be Asian</h1>
    <p>
    This is in reference to anyone with ethno-cultural heritage from the continent of Asia. While we recognize that many organizations may use terms such as AAPI, APA, API, or <a href="https://www.csusm.edu/apidafsa/who_is_apida/index.html">APIDA</a>, we believe in claiming the term of Asian in reference to pan-Asian solidarity. 
    </p>
    <p>
    We also recognize that the experiences and cultures of the Pasifika people <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/why-its-time-to-retire-the-term-asian-pacific-islander/">are distinct</a> from Asian experiences and cultures. We heartily welcome those with Pasifika heritage and hope to stand and learn alongside you. 
    </p>
    <h1>to be Catholic</h1>
    <p>
    This means being a part of the family of the Catholic Church. While we may inhabit a variety of perspectives and practices, we are willing to stick with our messy family in our journey with Christ. 
    </p>
    <h1>to be holistic</h1>
    <p>
    We recognize that the gravity of the Church has been situated on Western philosophies, theologies, experiences, and praxes. While there are many gifts that the West has both given and received from the Church, the Church is still wrestling with how other cultures shape the Church and how the inculturation of Christ takes form. To be holistic as an Asian Catholic is to celebrate where Christ has informed our cultures, to explore how Christ redeems our cultures, and to bring our whole selves as an offering to the Universal Body of Christ.

    <h1 >shared values</h1>
    <ul>

    <li><em>Respect:</em> we listen to one another as fellow image bearers of our Creator

    <li><em>Vulnerability:</em> we seek to share about ourselves and our cultures without reservation and foster an environment where everyone can feel safe to share

    <li><em>Openness:</em> we are willing to ask and wrestle with tough questions of life and faith

    <li><em>Joy:</em> we gather with intentionality and gratitude to reflect God’s love and gladness

    <li><em>Mutuality:</em> we understand that we need one another and that none are superior

    <li><em>Solidarity:</em> we work to stand alongside struggles of our communities and those of our neighbors

    <li><em>Honor:</em> we seek to understand our ancestral and cultural heritages and how Christ has and will work through them

    <li><em>Celebration:</em> we celebrate one another and our cultures, from birthdays to festivals and feasts!

    <li><em>Inclusion:</em> our personal and cultural gifts are not only for ourselves, but are desperately needed by the Church – we work for inclusion

    <h1>communal leadership</h1>
    <p>We have a core team which operates together, sharing leadership responsibilities and deciding by consensus. Some have more external facing roles while others have more contemplative roles; all are bound by prayer, seeking the guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
